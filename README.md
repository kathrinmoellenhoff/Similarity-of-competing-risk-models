# Similarity-of-competing-risk-models
This repository contains commented code for two manuscripts: "Similarity of competing risks models with constant intensities in an application to clinical healthcare pathways involving prostate cancer surgery" and "Testing similarity of parametric competing risks models for identifying potentially similar pathways in healthcare".
The code can be used to reproduce simulation results of the two manuscripts.
In addition, the pdf "Tutorial" explains how to use the code based on the first manuscript, i.e.  "Similarity of competing risks models with constant intensities in an application to clinical healthcare pathways involving prostate cancer surgery", for the application to real data sets in more general.
