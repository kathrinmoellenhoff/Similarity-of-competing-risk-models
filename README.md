# Similarity-of-competing-risk-models
This repository contains code for two manuscripts: "Similarity of competing risks models with constant intensities in an application to clinical healthcare pathways involving prostate cancer surgery" and "Testing similarity of parametric competing risks models for identifying potentially similar pathways in healthcare".
The code can be used to reproduce simulation results.
The pdf "Tutorial" explains how to use the code for the application to real data sets in more general.
