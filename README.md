# Similarity-of-competing-risk-models
Code corresponding to the manuscript: "Similarity of competing risks models with constant intensities in an application to clinical healthcare pathways involving prostate cancer surgery". 
The code can be used to reproduce simulation results for Scenario 1, presented in the simulation study of the manuscript, for both choices of censoring, that is administrative censoring and (exponential) right-censoring. The choice of the parameters is based on the application example. The code can easily be adapted to the other scenarios (2,3 and 4). 
The pdf "Tutorial" explains how to use the code for the application to real data sets in more general.
